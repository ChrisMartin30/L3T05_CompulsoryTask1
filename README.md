# L3T05_CompulsoryTask1
1st upload of a static website


This is for L3T05 of the HyperionDev, in partnership with the University of Edinburgh, Software Engineering course, Compulsory Task 1.

In this I have to upload a website that I previously developed earlier in the course. I have chosen the website created for L2T17 which was about Bootstrap where I made a very simple shop page, where fruit is "sold". It should show some basic bootstap responsiveness, and some basic CSS.
